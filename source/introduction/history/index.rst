Rust began as a side project of `Graydon Hoare <https://github.com/graydon/rust>`_ , an employee at `Mozilla <https://research.mozilla.org/rust/>`_ . In short order, Mozilla saw the potential of the new language and began sponsoring it, before revealing it to the world in 2010.
With contributions from `Dave Herman <https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2017/11/getting-to-know-dave-herman>`_, Brendan Eich, and others. The designers refined the language while writing the `Servo <https://servo.org/>`_ layout or browser engine, and the Rust compiler. 
It has gained increasing use in industry, and Microsoft has been experimenting with the language for secure and safety-critical software components.

What makes Rust stand out from all other languages is its marriage of low-level control with uncompromising safety

Rust is a multi-paradigm programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe concurrency. In terms of syntax, Rust is similar to C and C++, incorporating many of the keywords and commands from both languages. It is not a direct clone, however, and has some elements not found in either C or C++.,
but can guarantee memory safety by using a borrow checker to validate references. Rust achieves `memory safety <https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/01/fearless-security-memory-safety/>`_ without garbage collection, and reference counting is optional.

``rustc`` is the compiler for the Rust programming language, provided by the project itself. Compilers take your source code and produce binary code, either as a library or executable.
